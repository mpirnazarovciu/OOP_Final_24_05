and which can be retrieved through method <b>getUrl()</b>.
<br>
To participate in the forum users must be previously registered through method <b>registerUser()</b> 
that receives as arguments nickname, first name, last name, email address, and password. 
In case the nickname is duplicated, the method must generate DuplicatedNickname exception. 
The method returns a <b>User</b> object.
<br>
Class User provides the getter methods, <b>getNick()</b>, <b>getFirst()</b>, <b>getLast()</b>, 
and <b>getEmail()</b> to read the respective attributes values.
<br>
Class Forum privides the method <b>login()</b> that accepts a nickname and a password 
and if a user exists with matching nickname and password returns the corresponding object, 
otherwise it returns null.

<h3>R2. Topic</h3>
The forum is structured into topics that can be created through method <b>createTopic()</b> 
of class Forum receiving as arguments the name, the subject, and the user who creates it; 
the method returns a <b>Topic</b> object. Given a topic object its characteristics can be 
accessed through methods <b>getName()</b>, <b>getSubject()</b>, and <b>getUser()</b>.
<br>
Class Forum provides the method <b>listTopic()</b> returning a collection of the created topics.

<h3>R3. Messages</h3>
Users can submit messages to the topics through method <b>submitMessage()</b> of class Topic

Given a message it is possible to know title, body, user who submitted it, and topic in which 
it was submitted, respectively through the methods <b>getTitle()</b>, <b>getBody()</b>, <b>getUser()</b>, 
<b>getTopic()</b>. Moreover the method <b>getTimestamp()</b> returns the system time at which 
the message was submitted (i.e. the time when the submitMessage() method was called).
<br>
